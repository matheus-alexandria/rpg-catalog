## TTRPG Catalog

This is a TTRPG catalog made with NextJS. The purpose of this project is to catalog a number of TTRPG for anyone to
choose what to play based on a series of hints, experiences, rule summary and other data about each game.

This project is live in <a href='rpg-catalog-git-master-matheus-alexandrias-projects.vercel.app'>here</a>
